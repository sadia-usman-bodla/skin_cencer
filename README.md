# Skin Cancer Detection using CNN

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based model for **automatic detection of skin cancer** from dermoscopic images.  
This project aims to assist early diagnosis by classifying skin lesions into benign and malignant categories.

---

## **Project Overview**
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment.  
This project uses a **CNN deep learning model** to classify skin lesion images as:

- **Benign (Non-cancerous)**
- **Malignant (Cancerous)**

The model is trained on publicly available datasets of dermoscopic images.

---

## **Features**
- Automatic classification of skin lesions using CNN.
- High accuracy due to multiple convolutional layers and data augmentation.
- Easy-to-use Python scripts for training and prediction.
- Optional integration with a **Flask web app** for live predictions.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend / Model:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy  
- **Data Processing:** OpenCV, PIL, scikit-learn, pandas  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Optional Web Deployment:** Flask  

---

## **Dataset**
- The model is trained on **ISIC Skin Cancer Dataset** or any similar publicly available dataset.  
- Dataset contains labeled images of skin lesions: benign and malignant.
